Version 1.2.7 - 2014-04-29
- bugfix: librelp was incompatible with C++ without a real reason
  Thanks to Ivan Kryak for the patch
- bugfix: potential misadressing in wildcard match
  see: https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp/pull/3
  Thanks to Sebastian Schmidt for the patch.
- bugfix: always last wildcard match was reported, not first
  see: https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp/pull/4
  Thanks to Sebastian Schmidt for the patch.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.6 - 2014-03-20
- report error when preparing for non-anon TLS and this is unsupported
  The error is reported when the processes own certificate is set,
  which also turns off anon TLS. We now check if TLS AUTH is supported
  and, if not, return an error. This enables better error tracking
  in the client, as otherwise the problem is reported much later
  or even not at all (in the case of a relp server).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.5 - 2014-03-20
- permit to use anonymous TLS on platforms where GnuTLS misses
  certificate verification function. This permits to use at least
  anon TLS on platforms like RHEL and CENTOS 6.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.4 - 2014-03-17
- correct API/ABI change in 1.2.3
  My reasoning was flawed, and we could run into problems with
  apps that required the new version but could not detect that an
  older one was installed.
  Thanks to Michael Biebl for pointing this out.
  What we have done is:
  - revert back to previous state (return void)
    * relpSrvEnableTLS();
    * relpSrvEnableTLSZip();
    These functions are now deprecated.
  - introduce new functions that return a state
    * relpSrvEnableTLS2();
    * relpSrvEnableTLSZip2();
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.3 - 2014-03-13
  ************************************************************
  * NOTE: this version should NOT be used due to the API     *
  *       change specified below.                            *
  ************************************************************
- add ability to build librelp without TLS
  This is required on some platforms where GnuTLS is too old 
  Use --disable-tls to select this mode. If set, RELP_RET_ERR_NO_TLS
  will be returned on calls that selected TLS mode.
  See also: https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp/issues/1
- API change: two functions that used to return void now return state
  these are:
  * relpSrvEnableTLS();
  * relpSrvEnableTLSZip();
  This change is acceptable because the state must not necessary be
  evaluated. If not, the same error is returned a bit later in the
  calling sequence. Having it early, however, may help with better
  error messages. So it's still optional to check.
- bugfix: configure required too-old version of GnuTLS
  This lead to successful builds which later on would not execute.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.2 - 2014-01-07
- add capability to enable tcp KEEPALIVE
- introduced new API relpSrvSetKeepAlive() to support KEEPALIVE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.1 - 2013-09-26
- errors binding listener port are now reported via error message
  callback
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.0 - 2013-07-15
- support for epoll() added
  platforms that do not support it fall back to select()
- API extension: relpEngineSetOnGenericErr
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.5 - 2013-07-05
- bugfix: memory leak on connection close
  around 60 bytes of memory were lost on each connection close at the
  server side (when the client initiated a close)
- bugfix: potential misadressing on session close
  This can happen if also a write was outstanding, a quite unusable
  situation. In that case, already freed memory was being accessed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.4 - 2013-07-03
- fix build problems on BSD
  Thanks to Christiano for analysis and patch suggestion.
- add ability to specify a non-standard RELP Window size
- add burst support to the client API
  With this, we remove the unconditional performance improvement
  done in 1.1.3 - it is better to call the APIs explicitely.
- wildcards are now supported in TLS name peer authentication
  They follow RFC5425 recommandations, e.g.
  *.example.com, client*.example.com, client01.*.com
- new APIs: relpCltHintBurstBegin, relpCltHintBurstEnd,
  relpCltSetWindowSize
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.3 - 2013-06-26
- increased performance of RELP connection
- bugfix: potential segfault if no GnuTLS priority string was set
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.2 - 2013-06-24
- add capability to specify the GnuTLS priority string
  This gives callers complete control over crypto parameters, like
  ciphers to use.
- add certificate-based authentication
- add capability to specify number of Diffie-Hellman bits to use
- API extension: relpSrvSetDHBits, relpSrvSetGnuTLSPriString,
  relpSrvSetGnuTLSPriString, relpCltSetGnuTLSPriString
  relpEngineSetOnAuthErr, relpCltSetUsrPtr,
  relpSrvSetAuthMode, relpCltSetAuthMode
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.1 - 2013-06-11
- added compression support for TLS
- API extension: relpCltEnableTLSZip, relpSrvEnableTLSZip
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0 - 2013-06-03
- add TLS support
- new api for creating listners:
  ... which permits us to set various properties before the listener
  is actually started. New callers should use it. Sequence is:
  * relpEngineListnerConstruct()
  * ... set properties ... (via relpSrv...() family)
  * relgEngineListnerConstructFinalize()
  This new style permits us to add/set additional listner options
  without the need to introduce ever-new listner create functions.
  Actually, their number would grow exponentionally, so this were
  a dead end.
  The old-style APIs relpEngineAddListner() and
  relpEngineAddListner2() are still fully supported (and supposed
  to be for a long time), but flagged as deprecated.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.7 - 2013-05-13
- ABI change: removed relpCltConnect2() API which was against
  librelp API philosophy
  This was only introduced in 1.0.6 and been in the code for a very
  short time. So we decided that the best thing to do is actually
  remove it (there is NO known released user, this changes was for
  yet unreleased rsyslog 7.5.0).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.6 - 2013-05-06
- enhanced API to permit binding a client to a specific IP address
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.5 (rgerhards), 2013-04-24
- bugfix: compile problem on Solaris
  Thanks to John Lyman for the patch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (rgerhards), 2013-04-11
- bugfix: busy loop on syslog sending as a client when server did not
  accept data; this was broken out only when the remote peer
  indicated that the connection as whole was broken. Now we properly
  timeout.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (rgerhards), 2013-04-10
- added relpCltSetTimeout() interface function
- improved timeout handling
  Note: default timeout is now consistently 90 seconds (there were
  some parts of the code where it were 10 seconds and at others
  they were 180).
- provide support for user-settable shutdown indicator
  This was introduced in support of rsyslog, but is probably useful
  for other users as well. In short, it provides the ability to set
  a pointer that is expected to be zero as long as the library shall
  continue to run and set to 1 if it shall terminate. That ptr is then
  checked at appropriate places of the library code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (rgerhards), 2013-03-15
- added capability to support only IPv4/v6 instead of both
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (rgerhards), 2012-09-06
- added capability to stop server without canceling its thread
- bugfix: interrupt of select() was not properly handled
  However, this caused no actual failure, just some unnecessary code
  execution (and confusing debug messages).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (rgerhards), 2009-12-11
This version of librelp matured in practice and it is now time for
a 1.0 release. Besides that, it includes a small number of
changes:
- bugfix: user callback never received remote IP address
- bugfix: offers builder did use a fixed size string without bounds
  checking. I don't think this was a real issue as it was not
  exposed to the outside world, but now the buffer dynamically
  grows (which is the right thing to do). Thank to mterry for alerting
  me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.3 (rgerhards), 2009-02-10
- the callback on message reception did not contain a way to pass on
  a caller cookie (e.g. for an instance pointer). An additional
  interface has been added to support that.
- cleaned up FDL license specifics
- added libtool versioning
- made librelp compile out of the box on FreeBSD - thanks to Michael
  Biebl for the patch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.2 (rgerhards), 2008-04-09
- forward compatibility changes in support of our plans to use the
  rsyslog runtime in the future
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.1 (rgerhards), 2008-04-09
- improved build system, thanks to Michael Biebl
  now easier to integrate with autoconf
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.0 (rgerhards), 2008-04-01
- first version that is available to the public
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.0.1 (rgerhards), 2008-03-13
- very experimental and incomplete version, not to be used any longer
